*Abstract*

Anthropogenic changes in biodiversity and atmospheric temperature significantly influence ecosystem processes. However, little is known about potential interactive effects of plant diversity and warming on essential ecosystem properties, such as soil microbial functions and element cycling. We studied the effects of orthogonal manipulations of plant diversity (one, four, and 16 species) and warming (ambient, +1.5°C, and +3°C) on soil microbial biomass, respiration, growth after nutrient additions, and activities of extracellular enzymes in 2011 and 2012 in the BAC (biodiversity and climate) perennial grassland experiment site at Cedar Creek, Minnesota, USA. Focal enzymes are involved in essential biogeochemical processes of the carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus cycles. Soil microbial biomass and some enzyme activities involved in the C and N cycle increased significantly with increasing plant diversity in both years. In addition, 16-species mixtures buffered warming induced reductions in topsoil water content. We found no interactive effects of plant diversity and warming on soil microbial biomass and growth rates. However, the activity of several enzymes (1,4-β-glucosidase, 1,4-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase, phosphatase, peroxidase) depended on interactions between plant diversity and warming with elevated activities of enzymes involved in the C, N, and P cycles at both high plant diversity and high warming levels. Increasing plant diversity consistently decreased microbial biomass-specific enzyme activities and altered soil microbial growth responses to nutrient additions, indicating that plant diversity changed nutrient limitations and/or microbial community composition. In contrast to our expectations, higher plant diversity only buffered temperature effects on soil water content, but not on microbial functions. Temperature effects on some soil enzymes were greatest at high plant diversity. In total, our results suggest that the fundamental temperature ranges of soil microbial communities may be sufficiently broad to buffer their functioning against changes in temperature and that plant diversity may be a dominant control of soil microbial processes in a changing world.

*Experimental design*

The present study took place in the BAC experiment site established at the Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve, Minnesota, USA. The site occurs on a glacial outwash plain with sandy soils. Mean temperature during the growing season (April–September) was 15.98°C in 2011 and 17.18°C in 2012. Precipitation during the growing season was 721 mm in 2011. The growing season in 2012 was considerably drier, with 545 mm rainfall.

Experimental plots (9×9 m) were planted in 1994 and 1995 with different plant communities spanning a plant diversity gradient of one, four, and 16 species, which were randomly chosen from the species listed below (Tilman et al. 2001). The grassland prairie species belonged to one of five plant functional groups: C<sub>3</sub> grasses (_Agropyron smithii_ Tydb., _Elymus canadensis_ L., _Koeleria cristata_ (Ledeb.) Schult., _Poa pratensis_ L.), C<sub>4</sub> grasses (_Andropogon gerardii_ Vitman., _Panicum virgatum_ L., _Schizachyrium scoparium_ (Michx.) Nash, _Sorghas-trum nutans_ (L.) Nash), legumes (_Amorpha canescens_ Pursh., _Lespedeza capitata_ Michx., _Lupinus perennis_ L., _Petalostemum purpureum_ (Vent.) Rydb., _Petalostemum villosum_ Spreng.), nonlegume forbs (_Achillea millefolium_ L., _Asclepias  tuberosa_ L., _Liatris  aspera_ Michx., _Monarda fistulosa_ L., _Soldidago rigida_ L.), and woody species (_Quercus ellipsoidalis_ E. J. Hill, _Quercus macro-carpa_ Michx.). The individuals of those two woody species (_Quercus_ spp.), which were small in size and rare because of low survival, were removed from all plots in which they occurred in 2010.

In addition to the manipulation of plant diversity, the plots were divided into three subplots (2.5×3.0 m). Heat treatments were applied from March to November each year, beginning in 2009, using infrared lamps 1.8 m above ground emitting 600 W (which caused a 1.5°C increase in soil temperature for vegetation-freesoils) and 1200 W (which caused a 3°C increase; Valpine and Harte 2001, Kimball 2005, Whittingtonet al. 2013) to increase the surface soil temperature of each subplot (see Plate 1). To account for possible shading effects, metal flanges and frames were hungover control subplots. An average across all vegetated plots, temperature manipulations elevated soil temperature at 1 cm depth by 1.18°C in the low warming (+1.5°C) treatment and by 2.69°C in the high warming (+3°C) treatment, and at 10 cm depth temperature by 1.00°C in the low warming (+1.5°C) treatment and by 2.16°C in the high warming (+3°C) treatment.

Soil  samples  of  three  subplots  in  each  of  27 experimental plots were taken; due to technical difficulties we could only analyze 66 samples out of 81 existing subplots (monoculture, 10 replicates in ambient +0°C treatment, eight replicates in +1.5°C treatment, nine replicates in +3°C treatment; four species mixture, six replicates in ambient +0°C treatment, six replicates in +1.5°C treatment, seven replicates in +3°C treatment; 16 species mixture, six replicates in ambient +0°C treatment, six replicates in +1.5°C treatment, eight replicates in +3°C treatment). The BAC plots are a representative subset of the plots in the biodiversity experiment E120 at Cedar Creek, which were assembled as random draws of a given number of species from the species pool (Zak et al. 2003). Given low heterogeneity of soil abiotic conditions at the start of the experiment, the experiment was not blocked.

*Experimental design* **(condensed version)**

* Experimental plots were planted with different plant communities spanning a plant diversity gradient of one, four, and 16 species, which were randomly chosen from the species listed (5 plant functional groups -- 19 species in total)
* Plots were divided into three subplots
* Heat treatments were applied to subplots emitting 600 W (which caused a 1.5°C increase in soil temperature for vegetation-free soils) and 1200 W (which caused a 3°C increase) (control with 0°C included)
* Soil  samples  of  three  subplots  in  each  of  27 experimental plots were taken
* Given low heterogeneity of soil abiotic conditions at the start of the experiment, the experiment was not blocked
* Approximately 4.5g soil fresh mass was used to measure soil microbial biomass

## Simulating an experiment


- Consider simulating data for your experiment.


. . . 

- Enter your simulation scheme like below.

```{r}
mysimprocess <- myplan %>% 
  simulate_process(biomass = function(dmain = 10,
                                      hmain = -2.5,
                                      hdint = 0) {
    # generate some plot effect
    plot_effects <- setNames(rnorm(n(plot), 0, 40), unique(plot))
    # let's assume that the data generating process is as follows:
    160 + dmain * diversity + hmain * heat + hdint * diversity * heat  + 
      plot_effects[plot] + rnorm(n(), 0, 70)
  }) 
```

- The return object needs to be the same size as the number of rows for the design table.

## Simulating the data 

- How does the data look under different generating processes?

```{r}
sim1 <- mysimprocess %>% 
  simulate_rcrds(biomass = with_params(dmain = 10, hmain = -2.5, hdint = 0))

sim2 <- mysimprocess %>% 
  simulate_rcrds(biomass = with_params(dmain = 14, hmain = 2, hdint = -5))
```

. . . 

- Visualise, model and explore the simulated data...

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
g1 <- ggplot(sim1, aes(diversity, biomass, color = factor(heat))) +
  geom_jitter() +
  geom_smooth(method = lm) +
  scale_color_viridis_d() + theme_classic(base_size = 18)
```



::: flex

::: {.w-50}

```{r}
#| fig-height: 3.5
g1 + ggtitle("Sim 1")
```


:::

::: {.w-50 .pl3}

```{r}
#| fig-height: 3.5
g1 %+% sim2 + ggtitle("Sim 2")
```

:::

:::



## Try your planned analysis on simulated data {.scrollable}


::: flex

::: w-90

```{r}
lme4::lmer(biomass ~ factor(heat)*factor(diversity) + (1|plot), data = sim1)
lme4::lmer(biomass ~ factor(heat)*factor(diversity) + (1|plot), data = sim2)
```

- Try variations:

```{r}
lme4::lmer(biomass ~ heat*diversity + (1|plot), data = sim1)

lme4::lmer(biomass ~ heat*diversity + (1|plot), data = sim2)

summary(aov(biomass ~ heat*diversity + Error(plot), data = sim1))

summary(aov(biomass ~ heat*diversity + Error(plot), data = sim2))
```
