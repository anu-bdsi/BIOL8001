*Experimental design*

The present study took place in the BAC experiment site established at the Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve, Minnesota, USA. The site occurs on a glacial outwash plain with sandy soils. Mean temperature during the growing season (April–September) was 15.98°C in 2011 and 17.18°C in 2012. Precipitation during the growing season was 721 mm in 2011. The growing season in 2012 was considerably drier, with 545 mm rainfall.

Experimental plots (9×9 m) were planted in 1994 and 1995 with different plant communities spanning a plant diversity gradient of one, four, and 16 species, which were randomly chosen from the species listed below (Tilman et al. 2001). The grassland prairie species belonged to one of five plant functional groups: C<sub>3</sub> grasses (_Agropyron smithii_ Tydb., _Elymus canadensis_ L., _Koeleria cristata_ (Ledeb.) Schult., _Poa pratensis_ L.), C<sub>4</sub> grasses (_Andropogon gerardii_ Vitman., _Panicum virgatum_ L., _Schizachyrium scoparium_ (Michx.) Nash, _Sorghas-trum nutans_ (L.) Nash), legumes (_Amorpha canescens_ Pursh., _Lespedeza capitata_ Michx., _Lupinus perennis_ L., _Petalostemum purpureum_ (Vent.) Rydb., _Petalostemum villosum_ Spreng.), nonlegume forbs (_Achillea millefolium_ L., _Asclepias  tuberosa_ L., _Liatris  aspera_ Michx., _Monarda fistulosa_ L., _Soldidago rigida_ L.), and woody species (_Quercus ellipsoidalis_ E. J. Hill, _Quercus macro-carpa_ Michx.). The individuals of those two woody species (_Quercus_ spp.), which were small in size and rare because of low survival, were removed from all plots in which they occurred in 2010.

In addition to the manipulation of plant diversity, the plots were divided into three subplots (2.5×3.0 m). Heat treatments were applied from March to November each year, beginning in 2009, using infrared lamps 1.8 m above ground emitting 600 W (which caused a 1.5°C increase in soil temperature for vegetation-freesoils) and 1200 W (which caused a 3°C increase; Valpine and Harte 2001, Kimball 2005, Whittingtonet al. 2013) to increase the surface soil temperature of each subplot (see Plate 1). To account for possible shading effects, metal flanges and frames were hungover control subplots. An average across all vegetated plots, temperature manipulations elevated soil temperature at 1 cm depth by 1.18°C in the low warming (+1.5°C) treatment and by 2.69°C in the high warming (+3°C) treatment, and at 10 cm depth temperature by 1.00°C in the low warming (+1.5°C) treatment and by 2.16°C in the high warming (+3°C) treatment.

Soil  samples  of  three  subplots  in  each  of  27 experimental plots were taken; due to technical difficulties we could only analyze 66 samples out of 81 existing subplots (monoculture, 10 replicates in ambient +0°C treatment, eight replicates in +1.5°C treatment, nine replicates in +3°C treatment; four species mixture, six replicates in ambient +0°C treatment, six replicates in +1.5°C treatment, seven replicates in +3°C treatment; 16 species mixture, six replicates in ambient +0°C treatment, six replicates in +1.5°C treatment, eight replicates in +3°C treatment). The BAC plots are a representative subset of the plots in the biodiversity experiment E120 at Cedar Creek, which were assembled as random draws of a given number of species from the species pool (Zak et al. 2003). Given low heterogeneity of soil abiotic conditions at the start of the experiment, the experiment was not blocked.

## What's the response?

- We don't really need to know what the response to design the experiment.
- But it's better for experimental planning.

. . . 

<blockquote>

Soil samples were taken in August 2011 and 2012 (peak of the growing season) for soil microbial measurements and enzyme assays. From each subplot, nine (2011) or six (2012) soil samples were taken.

Approximately 4.5 g soil fresh mass was used to measure soil microbial biomass...

</blockquote>

. . . 

- First define the units that the response is going to be recorded on.

            sample = nested_in(visit,

                               82:162 ~ 6)) %>% 
  # short hand for allot_trts() + assign_trts() + serve_table()
  allot_table(diversity ~ plot,
                  heat ~ subplot,
              seed = 2023)
```


## Setting the record factor

```{r}
myplan <- mydesign %>% 
  set_rcrds(biomass = sample) %>% 
  expect_rcrds(biomass >= 0)
```

. . . 

- Export to data with the encoded data validation rules:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
export_design(myplan, "mydata.xlsx")
```

## Simulating an experiment

- Think of your **statistical analysis plan** at the designing stage!
- Simulate your experiment ... bla bla...
